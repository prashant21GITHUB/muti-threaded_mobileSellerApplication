# muti-threaded_mobileSellerApplication
This is an application for a wholesaler of  mobile phones.
Your application receives client orders and calculate the following statistics: 
•         Total dollars spent per client 
•         Total number of articles sold per mobile phone brand 
Statistics should be calculated as fast as possible once the client order has been received by your application. 
It is expected to receive in input a lot of orders at almost the same time.
At any time, a user interface can query the statistics based on a number of search criteria.

Main challenge behind this app is that, If same client requests multiple times at the same time, then the requests from the same client
must be served by same thread any any moment.

Note: Documentaion is written on each class.
